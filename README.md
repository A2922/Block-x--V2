Blocker X - A Security Extension

Overview
Blocker X is an ongoing development project aimed at protecting vulnerable users—such as children and elderly individuals—from malicious websites and apps. The goal is to create a robust browser extension that helps reduce the risk of scams, phishing, malware, and other online threats by blocking suspicious or harmful content.

This project was inspired by a personal experience where a young child unknowingly accessed a betting site, and was later prompted for sensitive information such as bank details. Situations like this are becoming increasingly common, affecting not just children but also elderly people who may not recognize such threats.

While we cannot fully eliminate all risks, we aim to significantly mitigate the chances of these types of attacks.

Age-Appropriate Controls: Specifically designed to protect:

Children (under 12) from accessing inappropriate or harmful content.
Elderly users who may be more vulnerable to online scams.


Roadmap
Phase 1 (Current):
Disabling copy, cut, and paste.
Restricting unwanted downloads.
